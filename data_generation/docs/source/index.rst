Welcome to life_td's documentation!
===================================

**life_td** stands for the LIFE Target Database 
<https://dc.zah.uni-heidelberg.de/voidoi/q/lp/custom/10.21938/ke_e6lzO_jjX_vzvVIcwZA> and contains information useful
for the planned LIFE mission <https://life-space-mission.com/> (mid-ir, nulling
interferometer in space). It characterizes possible
target systems including information about stellar,
planetary and disk properties. The data itself is mainly
a collection from different other catalogs. This is the documentation about 
the python data generation code for life_td.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information.
