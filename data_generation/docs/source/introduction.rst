============

Documentation Motivation
------------------------

The main goal of this documentation is to make both the code used to 
create the LIFE Target Database as well as the database itself follow 
the FAIR Principle.

FAIR
^^^^

TBD distinguish between FAIR data and FAIR software

**Findability** Contains richly annotated metadata to make clear what 
the data describes.

**Accessibility** Free and open source. The whole code can be accessed 
through `GitHub <https://github.com/fmenti/life_td>`_. Once run the 
code produces all the data that goes into the database. The database 
itself can be accessed through topcat or python (Check out the 
:ref:`LIFE Target Database Tutorial <tutorial>`).

**Interoperability** Independent of operating system. To access the 
database either python or Topcat is needed. Following the 
`Virtual Observatory standards <https://ivoa.net/>`_.

**Reuse** Provenance in form of sources and code provided to enable 
reproducing everything.
